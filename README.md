## Network Configuration

These modules presume there is an existing Virtual Network and Network Security Group to use. The Network Security Group must have at a minimum the following configuration:

* Allow inbound port 6443 between all nodes of the TFE cluster and the load balancer
* Allow inbound port 23010 between all nodes of the TFE cluster and the load balancer
* Allow inbound port 8800 from your operator network (could be the public internet) to allow for access to the operator dashboard
* Allow inbound port 443 to access the TFE application itself
